`rotating-fos` is a Java 7 library providing `RotatingFileOutputStream` which
internally rotates an underlying `FileOutputStream` using provided rotation
policies similar to [Log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/) or
[Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/).

# Usage

You first need to include `rotating-fos` in your Maven/Gradle dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vlkan.rfos</groupId>
    <artifactId>rotating-fos</artifactId>
    <version>${rotating-fos.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

`RotatingFileOutputStream` does not extend `java.io.FileOutputStream` (as a
deliberate design decision, see [How (not) to extend standard collection
classes](https://javachannel.org/posts/how-not-to-extend-standard-collection-classes/)),
but `java.io.OutputStream`. Its basic usage is pretty straightforward:

```java
RotationConfig config = RotationConfig
        .builder()
        .file("/tmp/app.log")
        .filePattern("/tmp/app-%d{yyyyMMdd-HHmmss.SSS}.log")
        .policy(new SizeBasedRotationPolicy(5000 /* 5s */, 1024 * 1024 * 100 /* 100MB */))
        .policy(DailyRotationPolicy.getInstance())
        .build();

try (RotatingFileOutputStream stream = new RotatingFileOutputStream(config)) {
    stream.writer("Hello, world!".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8))
}
```

`RotationConfig.Builder` supports the following methods:

| Method(s) | Default | Description |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `file(File)`<br/>`file(String)` | N/A | file accessed (e.g., `/tmp/app.log`) |
| `filePattern(RotatingFilePattern)`<br/>`filePattern(String)`| N/A | rotated file pattern (e.g., `/tmp/app-%d{yyyyMMdd-HHmmss-SSS}.log`) |
| `policy(RotationPolicy)`<br/>`policies(Set<RotationPolicy> policies)` | N/A | rotation policies |
| `timer(Timer)` | `Timer` | timer for scheduling policies |
| `lock(ReadWriteLock)` | `ReentrantReadWriteLock` | lock for synchronizing stream access (incl. rotations) |
| `append(boolean)` | `true` | append while opening the `file` |
| `compress(boolean)` | `false` | GZIP compression after rotation |
| `clock(Clock)` | `SystemClock` | clock for retrieving date and time |
| `callback(RotationCallback)` | `LoggingRotationCallback` | rotation callback |

Packaged rotation policies are listed below. (You can also create your own
rotation policies by implementing `RotationPolicy` interface.)

- `DailyRotationPolicy`
- `WeeklyRotationPolicy`
- `SizeBasedRotationPolicy`

Once you have a handle on `RotatingFileOutputStream`, in addition to standard
`java.io.OutputStream` methods (e.g., `write()`, `close()`, etc.), it provides
the following methods:

| Method | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `RotationConfig getConfig()` | used configuration |
| `List<Thread> getRunningThreads()` | compression threads running in the background |

# Caveats

- **Rotated file conflicts are not resolved by `rotating-fos`.** Once a
  rotation policy gets triggered, `rotating-fos` applies the given
  `filePattern` to determine the rotated file name. In order to avoid
  previously generated files to be overridden, prefer a sufficiently
  fine-grained date-time pattern.

  For instance, given `filePattern` is `/tmp/app-%d{yyyyMMdd}.log`, if
  `SizeBasedRotationPolicy` gets triggered multiple times within a day,
  the last one will override the earlier generations in the same day.
  In order to avoid this, you should have been using a date-time pattern
  with a higher resolution, such as `/tmp/app-%d{yyyyMMdd-HHmmss-SSS}.log`.

- **Make sure `RotationCallback` methods are not blocking.** Callbacks are
  invoked using the `Timer` thread passed via `RotationConfig`. Hence
  blocking callback methods are going to block `Timer` thread too.
